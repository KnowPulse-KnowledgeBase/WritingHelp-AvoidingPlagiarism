## Presentation Summary

### Paraphrase
- Not just a matter of using synonyms
- You need to create a new sentence structure
- Present in a distict way
- Preserve the essence of original text
- Add our own “Scholarly voice”
- It should sounds like it should be written by someone else

### Steps
1. Ensure you understand the work you want to cite.
- What key ideas can we highlight?
- By using your own words to show you understand the key ideas you develop vocabulary to use in your paraphrase

2. Just try it then evaluate your attempt. You should use many of the following techniques rather then just a few.
3. Add the citation.

**Ideally you would write the first draft without looking at the original!**
