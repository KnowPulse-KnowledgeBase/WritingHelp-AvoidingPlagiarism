## Presentation Summary (If you have no time to watch the video)

### Paraphrase
- Not just a matter of using synonyms
- You need to create a new sentence structure
- Present in a distict way
- Preserve the essence of original text
- Add our own “Scholarly voice”
- It should sounds like it is be written by someone else

### Steps
1. Ensure you understand the work you want to cite.
- What key ideas can you highlight?
- Using the key ideas to develop new vocabulary to use in your paraphrase

2. Just try it then evaluate your attempt. Use multiple techniques from the following rather than just a few.
3. Add the citation.

**PS: Ideally you would write the first draft without looking at the original!**

### Techniques
- Synonyms can help to create some differences, but don't rely on this technique too heavily.
- Change the order of the information provided: focus on the key point and start there.
- Change sentnce structure, change sentence length, active vs. passive sentences; change parts of speach, verb vs. noun
- Use difference punctuation (use semi-colons to join two ideas).
- Having style or sence of voice, but make sure the quote matches the style of the rest of your work. 
- Use quotation marks for 4+ content words in a row.
- Use signal words like “reported by”.
