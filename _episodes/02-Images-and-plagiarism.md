If the image that you are creating looks substantially different than the original(s), I do not think that copyright permission would be needed (i.e., the image would be your own). 
If the image that you create looks mostly or entirely like a copy of the original(s), then I think that would require permission from the copyright holder(s).

It is difficult to describe how to make your own image “different enough” from the original in order not to require copyright permission. 
It’s somewhat of a grey area and can depend on the type of images you’re working with. If you are combining elements of different images into a new single image, then it might be possible to use that in your thesis without needing copyright permission. 
Also, any images that have a Creative Commons (CC) licence can be used in your thesis without needing copyright permission, and some of the CC licences also allow adapting and modifying the images. If you’d like help to find more Creative Commons images to use, I’d be happy to assist.
You can search for them at https://search.creativecommons.org/. Also, information about the different CC licences and the uses they allow (e.g., whether an image can be modified or not) is available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/.
