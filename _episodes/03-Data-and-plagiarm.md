Our Data: Citing Date site provides some basic guidelines, but also links out to other sources of information. I'll bring your attention to the UBC guide specifically, as it connects best to this question. Of interest is the note that "Some dataset repositories also have their own guidelines and suggestions for how to construct a data citation, which elements to include, and where to find those on the site. Look carefully around the repository's website to see if you can find any information about citing their data."
