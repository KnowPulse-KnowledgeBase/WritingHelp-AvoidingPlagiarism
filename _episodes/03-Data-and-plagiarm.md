### Useful Resources 
Some basic data citing guidelines can be find on [Citing Data](https://libguides.usask.ca/data-guide/citation), but also links out to other sources of information. For example, [ UBC guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/c.php?g=707463&p=5035505) connects best regarding how to give credits to dataset reporsitories. Of interest is the note that "Some dataset repositories also have their own guidelines and suggestions for how to construct a data citation, which elements to include, and where to find those on the site. Look carefully around the repository's website to see if you can find any information about citing their data."
