### Please Note
The following context originally presents in a question-answer format between Dr. Bett's team and Kate Langrell. Kate Langrell is a copyright coordinator on the library staff at the University of Saskatchewan. If you have more questions about data citing, please contact [Kate Langrell](https://library.usask.ca/copyright/about-us/kate-langrell.php) directly. 

### Useful Resources 
Some basic data citing guidelines can be find on [Citing Data](https://libguides.usask.ca/data-guide/citation), but also links out to other sources of information. For example, the[ UBC guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/c.php?g=707463&p=5035505) provides a detailed overview of how to credict dataset repositories. Of interest is the note that "Some dataset repositories also have their own guidelines and suggestions for how to construct a data citation, which elements to include, and where to find those on the site. Look carefully around the repository's website to see if you can find any information about citing their data."
