This tutorial is rewritten into two parts: 
- The video presentation in Episode 1 was originally given by [Jill McMillan](https://library.usask.ca/people/jill-mcmillan.php) to Dr.Bett's lab in a meeting format.
- The rest episodes were originally presented in a question-answer format between Dr. Bett's team and [Kate Langrell](https://library.usask.ca/copyright/about-us/kate-langrell.php).
